## focus –Incentivize drivers

##Business challenge/requirement

Lithionpower is the largest provider of electric vehicle(e-vehicle) batteries.  It provides battery on a rental model to e-vehicle drivers. Drivers rent battery typically for a day and then replace it with a charged battery from the company. Lithionpower has a variable pricing model based on driver's driving history. As the life of a battery depends on factors such as overspeeding, distance driven per day etc.You as a ML expert have  to create a cluster model where drivers can be grouped together based on the driving data.

## Key issues
Drivers will be incentivized based on the cluster, so grouping has to be accurate 

## Considerations
NONE

## Data volume-4000 records –file driver-data.csv

## Fields in Data
* id: Unique Id of the driver 
* mean_dist_day: Mean distance driven by driver per day
* mean_over_speed_perc: Mean percentage of time a driver was > 5 mph over the speed limit

## Additional information-NA

## Business benefits
Increase in profits,up to 15-20% as drivers with poor history will be charged more
