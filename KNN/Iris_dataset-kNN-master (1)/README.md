# Iris Dataset - kNN

Computation of Iris Dataset using kNN algorithm 

The datasets for iris and the k-nearest neighbour classifier have been imported from the famous **Scikit-learn** library.

The algorithm finds the euclidean distance between the input points and the dataset points and makes predictions as to which species will the input value(flower) belong to. 

Categorises the input parameters _( Sepal length,width || Petal length,width )_ into the corresponding species **( Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica )**

## Instructions to use
### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/amyy28/Iris_dataset-kNN.git
```

Run the jupyter notebook.
Input unknown dimensions of a flower and get the classification results.
